# NightmareTown
 
Another game made for a QGDC game jam. This is one based on a nightmare I once had, where being outside in this liminal sort of town would get you abducted by monsters.
In this game, deliver items and close windows to keep from being grabbed and dragged into the Nightmare Door.

Lots of changes I'd like to make to this one. Firstly, given I only had 2 days, there are some physics that should be much improved (walking to the side, for example). There are also only 5 different sounds in this game, which should go up to at least several dozen by the end. The outside looking like the default Unity project is a problem especially since I have such a good idea for a rotating sky asset. Aside from some more number balancing, there are also features (like a siren system) that were impossible to implement in the given time since I made all the assets in those 2 days as well.

I hope to modify this soon!
